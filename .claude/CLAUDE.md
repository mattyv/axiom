# Axiom Project Instructions

## Essential Reading

When working on extraction-related tasks, always read these files first:
- `docs/extraction-order.md` - Documents the correct order and methodology for axiom extraction

## Project Context

This project extracts formal axioms from C/C++ code and specifications using:
- Clang LibTooling for C++ code analysis (tools/axiom-extract/)
- LLM enrichment for semantic enhancement
- Vector databases for semantic linking
- Neo4j for graph-based relationships
